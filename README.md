**vrms-rpm**
----------
A clone of *vrms* ("*virtual Richard M. Stallman*") for
RPM-based GNU/Linux distributions.

This program analyses the list of currently installed RPM packages and reports
found nonfree packages to stdout. 


**Why a clone instead of a fork?**
----------
Because my only experience with perl (which *vrms* is written in) was
one semester of Operating Systems class, and that was a long time ago.

Also, seeing how much the resulting program differs from the original, it's
quite possible that making a fork instead of starting fresh would only
complicate matters. After all, removing code is hard.


**Installing**
----------
No installation needed. Although if you insist on having the program in 
your PATH, you can just do the following:
```
$ sudo cp ./vrms-rpm.sh  /usr/bin/vrms-rpm
$ sudo cp ./vrms-rpm.man /usr/share/man/man1/vrms-rpm.1
```

Fedora users can use the *copr* repository [suve/vrms-rpm](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/suve/vrms-rpm/).
```
$ dnf copr enable suve/vrms-rpm
$ dnf install vrms-rpm
```
